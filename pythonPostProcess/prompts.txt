using pygame, I want to draw a 8x8 grid and values text in the center of each grid. The values should be pulled from an high performance python queue, and the queue should have pushed values from the program. Ideally, it should be two programs that communicates over the shared python queue (maybe threading ?) and data are sent over a very high frequency (up to 20kHz). The pygame defines a "fps-like" / tick per second loop that would pop the latest value from the queue, empty the queue for any older values and update the drawn grid. if no new values, it should keep the current values and not update. Please implement a refresh rate counter and parameter to determine how many data are readed per second. The grid colors should range according to value of each cases, ranging from 0 to 3000. use a simple light green to blue to dark purple gradient for far to close values. The queue will contain a python tuple or array of 64 int values. Please create also a simple program that inserts randomly as a test the values into the queue. Be sure to add some comment over the major steps
